This is the repository that holds my Module 4 Pandas-Challenge.

-"PyCitySchools_starter"-contains my code

-The "Resources" folder contains 2 csv files: "schools_complete" and "students_complete" which were the files given to us to work off

Module Overview: In this challenge, we were asked to analyze a cityâ€™s school district data to assist the school board/mayor in choosing the best decisions based on future school budgets and priorities. The following summaries were generated to display the data stratified by District, School, Highest- and Lowest-Performing School Percentage of Overall Passing, Math and Reading Scores by Grade, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type.
